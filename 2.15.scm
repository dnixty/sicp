;; The product of two intervals increases the percentage of tolerance
;; in comparison to tolerances of individual intervals. On the other
;; side the tolerance of sum of two intervals is the same as the
;; tolerance of the individual pieces. Thus par1 will increase the
;; tolerance value and the spread will be higher than in par2.
